# Pizza-Sales-Report
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data, providing insights into total revenue, order trends, best and worst-selling pizzas, and pizza category performance. The dashboard enables stakeholders to understand key metrics like revenue, order frequency, and category contributions.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and transformation
SQL: Advanced queries for generating KPIs
Power BI: Data modification, visualization, and further KPI generation
Data Cleaning & Transformation (Excel)
Removed duplicate records and standardized the dataset.
Fixed data entry issues, such as incorrect pizza sizes and categories.
Formatted dates and sales numbers to ensure consistency across the dataset.
Transformed raw data into structured formats for analysis in SQL and Power BI.

KPI Generation (SQL)
Used advanced SQL queries to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
Total Revenue: $818K
Total Orders: 21,350
Average Order Value: $38.31
Total Pizza Sold: 50,000
Analyzed sales trends based on pizza categories (e.g., classic, supreme, chicken, veggie).
Calculated the performance of different pizza sizes (e.g., large, medium, regular).


Data Modification & Visualization (Power BI)
Imported cleaned and transformed data from Excel and SQL.
Created interactive visuals including:
Sales Performance: By pizza category and size.
Daily and Monthly Order Trends: Visualized the busiest days (weekends, especially Friday/Saturday evenings) and months (July and January).
Top/Bottom Selling Pizzas: Identified best and worst sellers by revenue and quantity.
Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Large pizzas contributed the most to revenue (45.89%).
Generated additional KPIs in Power BI for real-time data exploration.


Key Insights
Best Sellers: The Thai Chicken Pizza generates the highest revenue.
Order Patterns: Weekends are the busiest times, with a peak in orders during July and January.
Pizza Size: Large pizzas are the most popular, contributing significantly to sales.


Conclusion
The Pizza Sales Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of sales performance, identifying trends and areas for improvement in product offerings, order patterns, and category-based analysis.
